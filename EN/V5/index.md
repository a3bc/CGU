    framework for the resulting cross-border flows.

    to the purposes for which your data was collected.

# 9. How do we ensure the security of your personal data?

1\. The security of your personal data is very important to A3BC Group.

2\. We have implemented technical and organisational measures
    appropriate to the degree of sensitivity of the personal data, in
    order to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data and
    protect them against malicious intrusion, loss, alteration or
    disclosure to unauthorised third parties.

# 10. Do we use processors?

1\. Where we use a service provider, we will only disclose personal data
    to them after obtaining a commitment and guarantees from them that
    they will be able to meet security and confidentiality requirements.

2\. In compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations, the
    contracts concluded with our processors set out precisely the terms
    and conditions of the processing of personal data by them in
    accordance with personal data protection laws.

# 11. Do we use cookies?

1\. More information about cookies can be found in our Cookie Policy.

# 12. What are your rights?

1\. A3BC Group is committed to respecting your rights in relation to the
    data we process, in order to guarantee fair and transparent
    processing taking into account the particular circumstances and
    context in which your personal data are processed.

## 12.1 Your right of access

1\. You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not your
    personal data are being processed and, where that is the case,
    access to your data and the following information:

-   the purposes of the processing;

-   the categories of personal data concerned;

-   the recipients or categories of recipient, and where applicable the
    international organisations, to whom the personal data have been or
    will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries;

-   where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data
    will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine
    that period;

-   the existence of the right to request from the controller
    rectification or erasure of your personal data or restriction of
    processing of your personal data or to object to such processing;

-   the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

-   where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any
    available information as to their source;

-   the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling,
    and, at least in the latter case, meaningful information about the
    logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
    consequences of such processing for the data subject.

## 12.2 Your right to rectification of your data

1\. You have the right to ask us, as the case may be, to rectify or
    complete your personal data that are inaccurate, incomplete,
    ambiguous or expired.

## 12.3 Your right to erasure of your data 

1\. You have the right to ask us to erase your personal data in the
    cases provided for by laws and regulations.

2\. Please note, however, that the right to erasure is not a general

    in the applicable laws is met.

## 12.4 Your right to restriction of processing of your data

1\. You have the right to request restriction of processing of your
    personal data in the cases provided for by laws and regulations.

    based on the legitimate interest pursued by the controller (see
    clause above on the legal bases for processing).

2\. If you exercise your right to object, we will no longer process your
    personal data for the processing concerned unless we demonstrate
    compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which must override
    your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment,
    exercise or defence of legal claims.

## 12.6 Your right to data portability

1\. You have the right to portability of your personal data. Please
    note, however, that the right to data portability is not a general

    right to data portability only concerns processing carried out by
    automated means to the exclusion of manual or paper processing.

2\. This right is limited to processing based on your consent, on the
    performance of a contract or on the taking of steps prior to
    entering into a contract.

3\. This right does not include derived or inferred data, which are
    personal data created by A3BC Group.

1\. Where the processing of personal data we carry out is based on your
    consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. We
    will then stop processing your personal data but this will not
    affect the operations based on consent before its withdrawal.

    Fontenoy 75007 Paris) on the French territory without prejudice to
    any administrative or judicial remedy.

1\. You have the right to give special instructions on how your personal
    data should be stored, erased and shared after your death. These
    special instructions only concern, and will be limited to, the
    processing carried out by us.

2\. You also have the right, when that person will be designated by the
    executive branch, to give general instructions for the same purpose.

## 12.10 How to exercise your rights?

1\. You may exercise the rights listed above by sending a request,
    together with a document proving your identity by any means, by
    email to contact.trustme@a3bc.org or by post to A3BC Group chez
